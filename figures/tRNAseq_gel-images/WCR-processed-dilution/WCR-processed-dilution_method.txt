Whole cell RNA processed following the steps under “RNA oxidation, β-elimination and size selection”.
Starting with 10 ug whole cell RNA (as the protocol) and performing RNA oxidation and β-elimination. Lastly the dephosphorylation was performed and a 2-fold dilution (using water as diluted) of this was made such that dilution 1 had 10 uL of the dephosphorylation reaction, dilution 2 had 5 uL of the dephosphorylation reaction and 5 uL water, etc. 


Gel loading from left to right (with respect to the volume of the dephosphorylation reaction):
Ladder, 10uL, 5uL, ..., Ladder


This gel should be compared to the gel run unprocessed whole cell RNA. See WCR_dilution_35min
