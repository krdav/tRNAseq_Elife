Testing PCR cycle for optimal amplification (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9qwRS7tQZRz0o5nmHvRHwoByPNbpHCqIlUBHJIcl30/edit#gid=0).
Using P10 circles and the same reaction mix as described in my tRNAseq protocol.
Only ran 20 uL per tube and then setup PCR machine to run 22 cycles (excluding the 3 early cycles).
Then removed samples at cycle 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22.
Added 5 uL loading buffer, then loaded 5 uL per well onto a 4-12% TBE gel.
Gel loading from left to right:
Ladder, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, Ladder
