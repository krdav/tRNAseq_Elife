Whole cell RNA (no pretreatment, dephosphorylation or anything) run on 10% denaturing gel for 35 min.
Doing 2-fold dilution starting at 10 ug per well.
Gel loading from left to right:
Ladder, 10ug, 5ug, ..., Ladder


This gel should be compared to the gel run on RNA processed following the steps under “RNA oxidation, β-elimination and size selection”. See WCR-processed-dilution
