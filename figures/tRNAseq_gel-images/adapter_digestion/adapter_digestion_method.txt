Adapter digestion time test.
Made replicated digestion conditions under "Adapter ligation to tRNA 3’ ends" (step 4).
Briefly, mixed 1 uL of each of the 4 adapters with 16 uL water, then added:
3 μL NEB buffer 2
1 μL Superase In
2 μL RecJf
2 μL 5´ Deadenylase
2 μL SSB (1 μg/μL)

This reaction was doubled to a total of 60 uL.
Then incubated at 30C for a 6 point 2-fold time-course: 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 min
Each sample was 9 uL (15% of total volume) i.e. equivalent to 0.15*8=1.2 uL of adapter.
These samples were removed from the same tube while incubating on PCR machine.
Each sample was purified using the Oligo purification kit, then eluted with 10 uL water.

To approximate the adapter depletion a 6 point 4-fold dilution of the adapter mix was also made starting with the equivalent to 1.2 uL of adapter i.e. same as t0 for the digestion time test. In percent of t0 this should be: 100, 25, 6.3, 1.56, 0.39, 0.10


Added 10 uL loading buffer, then loaded all onto a 10% TBE UREA denaturing gel.
Gel loading from left to right:
[dilution series, time series]
100%, 25%, 6.3%, 1.56%, 0.39%, 0.10%, 0 min, 8 min, 16 min, 32 min, 64 min, 128 min


Normal exposure was automatic at 0.7 s.
Long exposure was adjusted to 3 s.



Previously, also tried adapter digestion directly in the ligation reaction.
This does work when supplemented with NEB buffer 2, but the reaction is not as efficient.
Digestion directly in the ligation reaction does NOT work when the enzymes are added without NEB buffer 2, and also does not work when NEB buffer 1 is added.
In fact, adding the adapters directly with NEB buffer 1 and the enzyme mix still didn't work, so presumably RecJf is quite sensitive to the buffer choice.
Also, it turns out that running sample in digestion buffers/enzymes retards the migration of the adapters.
