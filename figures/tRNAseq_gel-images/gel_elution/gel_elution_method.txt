Using previously purified tRNA/cDNA fraction to test the recovery of the gel purification method.
Pooled several purified tRNA/cDNA fractions (old tRNAseq samples).
Ran everything in 4 technical replicates.


tRNA fraction (t) => 160 uL x 26.6 ng/uL
Use 300 ng per test
Dry, then reconstitute in 70 uL water ~ 300 ng per 5 uL
Take 4x 5uL for “Loading” samples. Add 10 uL water to reach final volume of 15 uL and keep in freezer until TapeStation (20 ng/uL expected).
Take 4x 5uL for gel ("Elution" samples). Mix with loading buffer, run gel, cut out bands and perform quick gel purification (as described under "Size selection using polyacrylamide gel"). Elute with 15 uL water and transfer to PCR strip.
Transfer 5 uL of all samples to fresh PCR strip and send for TapeStation (RNA HighSense)
Use Tecan to quantify RNA spectroscopically.

cDNA fraction (c) => 100 uL x 8.5 ng/uL
Use 60 ng per test
Dry, then reconstitute in 70 uL water ~ 60 ng per 5 uL
Take 4x 5uL for “Loading” samples. Add 10 uL water to reach final volume of 15 uL and keep in freezer until TapeStation (4 ng/uL expected).
Take 4x 5uL for gel ("Elution" samples). Mix with loading buffer, run gel, cut out bands and perform quick gel purification (as described under "Size selection using polyacrylamide gel"). Elute with 15 uL water and transfer to PCR strip.
Transfer 5 uL of all samples to fresh PCR strip and send for TapeStation (RNA HighSense)
Use Tecan to quantify ssDNA spectroscopically.


cDNA samples were not very well quantified using TapeStation.
First try running them using D1000 HighSense DNA method, but nothing was detected.
Using HighSense RNA, peaks are detected, presumably the correct size, but quantification is hard because the peak intensity is so low. This is probably because the dye used for TapeStation is not very specific for ssDNA.
